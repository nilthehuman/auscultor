auscultor - an NLP hobby project
================================

This repository is basically a sandbox where I fiddle around with
Python's Natural Language Toolkit to see if I can segment, tokenize
and roughly interpret some English language text from the wild.

[todo: explain python3 -m auscultor target]

Here's a rough roadmap of what I'm going to try and make happen:
- detect if input is in English
- word classification
- topic identification for the whole input
- topic identification per sentence?
- eventually make a simple web frontend for the application?
