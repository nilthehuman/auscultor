auscultor â€“ an NLP hobby project
================================

This repository is basically a sandbox where I fiddle around with
Python's Natural Language Toolkit to see if I can segment, tokenize
and roughly interpret some English language text from the wild.

Here's a rough roadmap of what I'm going to try and make happen:
- sentence segmentation
- word segmentation
- word classification
- topic identification for the whole input
- topic identification per sentence?
